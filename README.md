# VSCodeColors
I am trying to find the colors used in VSCode(ium) for use in WebDev.
I started using the GIMP color picker to find the colors of the editor.
This is a CSS file declaring variables with fitting names holding hex color codes.

I used these names for the colors (with an "VS" on front):
- Toolbar:
  - Contains the colors of the toolbar on top ( File | Edit | ...)
- Sidebar:
  - The toolbar with the icons for Explorer | Search | Source Control | Run | Extensions
- Explorer
  - The tab that pops out of the sidebar
- VSBlue:
  - Used in the blue bar at the bottom and the notification bubble in the toolbar
- VSOrange:
  - Color of the "blue" bar at the bottom while debugging
- TopToolbar:
  - The toolbar holding open the tabs for open files
- Tab:
  - The tabs for the opened files
  - Includes the  language icon colors
- Editor:
  - The actual text editor
  - The code overview scrollbar
  - Contains the syntax highighting
- Debugger:
  - The colors of the debugging bar
  

Feel free to verify the colors and commit colors that I missed.
